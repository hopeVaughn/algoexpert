/*
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

Tip: While the integers in the input array are sorted in increasing order, their squares won't necessarily be as well, because of the possible presence of negative numbers

Sample input:
array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9]

sample output:
[1,4,9,25,36,64,81]
*/
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
function sortedSquaredArray(array) {
  // Write your code here.
  return [];
}

console.log(sortedSquaredArray(array));
